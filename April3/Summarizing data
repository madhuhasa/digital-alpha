Exploratory Analysis Techniques:

    Box-Plot
    Histogram
    Trend analysis
    Scatter Plots



Steps to summarize sample data for EDA: 
i)Identify Business Problem:
 				“Define Problem statement”
This is the first step of analysis. Business identifies a problem and a problem statement with desired outcome is defined. 
In this stage, a Data Scientist should understand the problem statement, the domain knowledge of the problem. After thorough 
understanding of the problem statement, a Hypothesis will be proposed.

ii)Data Acquisition:
				“Identify data sources”
As a second step, all the data sources related to the problem statement will be identified and pulled into a central repository. 
The data sources can vary from SQL databases to text files to csv files to online data. If the data size is large we may use 
Hadoop to pull, store & pre-process the data.

iii)Process/Clean Data:
 				“The accuracy of the results of analysis depends on the quality of data” 
Data Clean step is considered to be one of the very important phases in Data analysis. The accuracy of the analysis depends 
on the quality of data.
Few approaches:

    Formatting the data as per the data analytical tools we use.
    Missing data handling
    Data Transformations like normalizing the data Identifying outliers & handling etc.

iv)Exploratory Analysis:
 				“Embrace the data visually before diving further”
The objective of this step is to understand the main characteristics of the data. This analysis is generally done using visualizing 
tools. Performing an Exploratory analysis helps us:

    to understand causes of an observed event
    to understand the nature of the data we are dealing with
    assess assumptions on which our analysis will be based
    to identify the key features in the data needed for the analysis
